# Iterators and Closures

## Closures

Closures are function like constructs that you can store in a variable. They are functions without names that we can save inside a variable or pass to other functions.

> The term "closure" is used to be explicit about the ability of these functions to capture and manipulate variables from their enclosing scope, which may involve complex ownership and borrowing rules.

assuming giving the following the following of Cities:

```rs
struct City {
    city: String,
    population: u64,
}

let mut vec: Vec<City> = Vec::new();
vec.push(City {
        city: String::from("A"),
        population: 100,
    });
vec.push(City {
        city: String::from("B"),
        population: 80,
    });
vec.push(City {
        city: String::from("C"),
        population: 70,
    });
```

we can try to sort it in two ways. `with closures`

```rs
fn pop_helper(pop: &City) -> u64 {
    pop.population
}
vec.sort_by_key(pop_helper);
```

```rs
vec.sort_by_key(|p| p.population);
```

another thing note is that closures contains type annotations. which makes it more powerful than `python lambdas`, however in general `rust closures are similar to python lambdas`. eg:

```rs
let add = |x: i32| -> i32 { x + 1 };
// the same thing as:
fn add_one(x: i32) -> i32 {
    x + 1
}

let add_v2 = |x| x + 1;
add_v2(5 as i32); // correct
add_v2(7 as i128); // error
```

Closures are not allocated on the `heap` unless placed inside a `collection` like `vectors`

## Iterators

Iterators are a way of processing  a series of elements

all iterators implements the following trait:

```rs
pub trait Iterator {
    type Item;
    fn next(&mut self) -> Option<Self::Item>;
    /// default methods
}
```

An iterator is any type that implements the iterator trait. E.g

```rs
struct Item {
    name: String,
}

let mut vec: Vec<Item> = Vec::new();
    vec.push(Item {
        name: String::from("water"),
    });
    vec.push(Item {
        name: String::from("shoes"),
});

let itm = vec.into_iter().filter(|i| i.name == product).collect()
println!("{:?}", itm);
```
