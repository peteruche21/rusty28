# Enums and Patterns Matching

enums or enumerations are datatypes that allow you to define a type which can have a fixed set of distinct values.

```rs
enum Color {
    Red,
    Blue,
    Yellow,
}
```

- the distinct values in an `enum` are reffered to as variants. i.e `Red`, `Blue` and `Yellow` are variants.
- enums just like structs can also have methods

  ```rs
  impl Color {
    fn get_color(self) -> &'static str {
        match self {
            Color::Red => "from mars",
            Color::Blue => "from the ocean",
            Color::Yellow => "from the sun",
        }
    }
   }

   let color = Color::Red;
   color.get_color();
   // from mars
  ```

- enums can hold multiple types
- enums can have associated values

  ```rs
  enum Cars{
    Mercedes(String),
    Ford(i32),
    Tesla(bool),
  }
  ```

## Options

it allows us to allow for a value to be something or to be nothing which is comparable to null in javascript.
Option is important when we want the code to run if we have some `T`, or we want to have null || nothing

```rs
let some_num = Some(5);
let some_str = Some("a string");
let nothing: Option<i32> = None;
```

## Match

allows us to compare a value against a series of patterns and execute code if the value matches.
matches in rust are exhaustive, meaning we need to explicitly define the cases or add a catchall.

```rs
fn plus_one(x: Option<i32>) -> Option<i32> {
    match x {
        None => None,
        Some(i) => Some(i + 1),
        _ => Some(0), // catch all
    }
}

let five = Some(5);
let six = plus_one(five);
```

- `if - let` statements can be used as alternative to write the equivalent of `match` that has only one case

  ```rs
     let something = Some(Color::Yellow);

    if let something = Some(Color::Yellow) {
        println!("{}", "Probably roasted already");
    }
  ```
