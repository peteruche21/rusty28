# Basics

## tuples

Tuples are a fixed size data structure that can accommodate a number of values of different types.
it's size is however fixed at runtime.

```rust
let tup: (&str, i32) = ("obi", 24);
```

Tuple types are `(type a, type b ...)`

## arrays

Similar to tuples, arrays are fixed in size, but can only accept values of the same type i.e **Homogenous**.

```rust
let arr: [i32, 5] = [1,2,3,4,5];
```

Array types are `[type of data, length]`

## vectors

Vectors are dynamically size data structures that can grow or shrink and also **Homogenous**

There are several ways on how to declare a vector

```rust
// creates a vector from an array
let vec1 = vec![0,1,2,3,4];

// creates a new vector
let vec2 = Vec::new();

// creates a vector with capacity
let vec3 = Vec::<i32>::with_capacity();
```

vector types are `Vec::<type of data>`

The capacity of a vector is the amount of memory allocated to store its elements. it typically represents the amount of space the vector has reserved for future elements.

you can use methods `push` and `pop` for adding or removing data.

## Slice

Each of the structures above can be stored in a specific memory slot. and references `&` can point to their location in memory but not own it.

- Ordinary references points to a single value.
- Slice references points to a range of consecutive values.

giving the vector above: we can slice the index `0 - 4`

```rust
let sv: &[i32] = &vec1[0..4]
// output: [0, 1, 2, 3]
```

## Strings

strings are stored as a `Vector` of bytes, they are growable, allocated in the heap, strictly a utf8 sequence and not null-terminated.

```rust
let str1 = String::from("peter"); // a string
let str2 = "peter".to_string(); // string too
let str3 = "peter" // a slice
let str4 = &str1; // also a slice
```
