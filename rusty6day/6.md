# Crates, Modules and Common Collections

## Packages, Crates, Modules

1. packages: allows us to build test and share crates, it is one or more crates that would provide functionality
2. crates: are a tree of modules that produces a library or an executable, they are about code sharing between projects.
3. modules: let us control the organization, scope and privacy of pass, they are about code sharing within a project
4. pass: are a way of naming an item such as Struct, Function or module

## Collections

collections are data structures that allow you to store and manipulate multiple values of the same or different types. eg vector. some more collections include.

## Binary Heaps

a binary heap is a collection whose elements is loosely organized, the greatest value is always up-front

## Maps

maps are collections of key pair values, and each key in the map must be unique.
rust has hash maps and binary tree maps

- hash maps are stored in a single heap allocated table
- binary trees maps are stored in tree like structure growing from top to down to what is known as nodes

## Sets

sets can be used to quickly check if a value exists. sets cannot contain duplicates

- hash sets
- binary tree sets
